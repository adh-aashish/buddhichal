# Buddhichal

Buddhichal is a game played by locals in Nepal from long time ago. This game is usually played by marking in the mud or stone and using 
leaves and stone as peices. This beutiful game is now getting extinct as children today are more into mobile games. This is my attempt to 
revive the game that I loved to play when I was a child. There is both multi-player and single-player mode.
